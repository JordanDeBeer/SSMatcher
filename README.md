# SSMatcher
A simple "Secret Santa" matcher.  One in go and one in Python

## About
I made this project on a whim.  I tend to "think" in Python so I did it there first.  I also decided to make it in Go in an attempt to understand it better.  Neither algorithm is perfect and both are likely extremely inefficient.  That said, everyhting works and it was fun to make.
